# ALTANTIS
A possible bot for an upcoming Megagame run by Warwick Tabletop.

Important features:
[x] Can have submarines, which move.
[x] Has a map with obstacles.
[x] Can turn the sub off and on. (Allowing players to dock.)
[x] Submarines can travel at multiple speeds.
[x] Full power management. Can power systems, but has a power cap (which can be increased by control).
[ ] Can broadcast messages to all in range (via Comms system, which garbles longer-distance messages).
[ ] Can activate scanners, and inform players when they hover over things (level 1), are near things and other named subs (level 2), and further afield (level 3). Identify things via distance (0 moves away... 5 moves away).
[ ] Can shout at an engineer - control gives a question and answer, and then the engineer has to give a response. Ship takes more damage if the engineer gets it wrong.
[ ] Control can drop items on the seafloor, along with players if they so wish.
[ ] Basic inventory management. (!give for control.)
[ ] Basic resources.

Important non-gameplay features:
[ ] Save bot state to disk with each game loop, as to avoid any issues.
