# ALTANTIS
A possible bot for an upcoming Megagame run by Warwick Tabletop.

Important features:
[ ] Can turn the sub off and on. (Allowing players to dock.)
[ ] Can shout at an engineer - control gives a question and answer, and then the engineer has to give a response. Ship takes more damage if the engineer gets it wrong.
[ ] Full power management. Can power systems, but has a power cap (which can be increased by control).
[ ] Can activate scanners, and inform players when they hover over things.
[ ] Control can drop items on the seafloor, along with players if they so wish.
[ ] Basic inventory management. (!give for control.)
[ ] Basic money.

Important non-gameplay features:
[ ] Save bot state to disk with each game loop, as to avoid any issues.
